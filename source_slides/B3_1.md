note:
One thing we know for sure about AI, according to the internet, is that it's all about white robots against blue backgrounds.
Problem: Image as laden with historical assumptions about gender, ethnicity and religion. They set unrealistic expectations and misrepresentation of the possibilities and limitations of AI.

note:
Refracted version of ourselves. Refraction is when a weave changes direction and shape as it passes from one medium to another. In optics this often refers to how light is bent and reshaped as it goes through different lenses. Controlling the shape of light through optical lenses is one of the key principles of photography. 
What we now think of as AI is built on top photographic images.

In a wider sense: AI creates multiple refractions of culture; multiple versions of events, and observations that are brought together to form a coherent whole. 

"Better Images of AI" is a non-profit collaboration of various individuals, non-profit and academic institutions in the UK, e.g. BBC R&D, the Ada Lovelace Institute, and a charity organisation called We and AI.

note:
These photographs are known as “die-shots“. 
A die is a small block of semiconducting material, such as Silicon, that serves as the supporting material on which an integrated circuit is fabricated. 
Die-shots are close-up photographs of computer chips, from which the “packaging“ is removed. The typical bright rainbow colors in die-shots do not represent the actual colors of the chips, which are mainly gray and silver. The artist has used a combination of external light sources, polarising filters on the camera lense and image post production to create the colourful effect. This picture shows a “Radeon R9 290” by AMD.

>The cinematographer was a mechanical eye cast **on** society while inductive machine vision is a computational eye drawn **from** society; the former can reflect or obscure existing power relations, the latter embodies them.
